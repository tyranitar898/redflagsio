      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Red Flags is a party game about convincing your friends to go on
        terrible dates.
      </p>
      <h2>Here's how it works</h2>
      <p>
        One of your friends is going to be the "single". <br />
        Every other player uses TWO perk cards to make a hot date that they
        think would be a great match for that person.
      </p>

      <h2>You'll get characteristics (perk) cards like:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>is a brain surgeon</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>loves to cuddle</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>is an olympic gymnast</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>loves video games</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>owns your favorite sports team</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        But then everyone also gets Red Flag cards like:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Keeps mosquitoes as pets</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Uses Crayola as make up</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Can only walk horizontally</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Using one of your red flags you can now ruin one of your freinds suggested date. Now all of these perfect dates will have flaws like:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>An olympic gymnast that loves video games who keeps mosquitoes as pets</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A brain surgeon who loves to cuddle but uses Crayola as make up</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A millionaire who is humble but Can only walk horizontally</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        Now that all of the dates are horrible, everyone tries to convince the
        single to go out with their date. <br />
        That's pretty much it. The game can be as raunchy or tame as your
        imaginations allow.

      <img src={howto1} alt="" width="80%" height="80%" />
      <h2>
        Then submit those two perks by clicking the submit match button at the
        bottom of the page.

        After you see all the ponential matches, tag a redflags onto a match you
        want to ruin.
      </h2>

      <img src={howto4} alt="" width="80%" height="80%" />
      <h2>
        Finally when all the dates are ruined the current single will decide on
        the best date the went to go on.
